Academic Projects 
Computer Usage Time Controller (Group Project)
•	Developed an educational web application in Java and MySQL which greatly improved the way in which faculty monitored student activities including grade performance and assignments.
•	Utilized JavaScript (scripting language) for designing the front end to display tables, fields and buttons on the browser. 
•	User needs to fulfil the authentication process to access the application. Once user is logged in, he/she can upload the assignment and also access other course documents. Instructor can view and grade student assignments. 


Beta University donation database (Ongoing Project)

•	Developing a 3 tier application using PHP, JAVA and MySQL database where donor (user) can enter their basic details i.e. his/her name, address and graduation year.
•	User then selects a department to make a donation.
•	Based on the amount of donation the user is categorized into a specific circle e.g. golden, platinum etc.
•	User the selects a payment method check, credit or debit and enter the corresponding details.
•	Planning to implement captcha to verify that the form is not filled by any kind of robot.

•	Designed the game in such a way that computer wins or ties the game with end user. 
User Authentication
•	Designed a login page in which the user first registers his/her user name. 
•	User can then log in and the username and password are authenticated on the server. 
•	This was implemented using 2 diff methods: database cookies and text file.

Extra curriculum Projects 
Cab Invoice Generator (Ongoing Project)
•	The project involves designing a software using MySQL, JDBC, Java Servlets, HTML, JavaScript technologies for generating and storing cab invoices.
•	Utilizing Java Swing, Servlets, HTML and JavaScript to develop client side components (Front-End).
•	Using MySQL database to store necessary data and JDBC defines how a client can access the data via front end. 
•	Software can import text file (forms filled by customer) to gather crucial client’s information for generating an invoice. 

Online Python course (Coursera) 
An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Rice University) 
Rental vehicle management application (On-going project):
•	Developing a GUI based vehicle rental application in which a customer can rent a vehicle. 
•	The application needs customers contact and driving license details, insurance information, car details, mileage, fuel tank status and credit card information for approving the rental. 
•	At the time of return, application needs the total mileage on the car, car details and fuel tank status.
